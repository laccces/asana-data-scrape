*Asana Time Export Script*

This script uses the Asana API in order to find and return time entry data from within a set time period. The default setting is for one month, but this can be adjusted as required.

Unfortunately Asana doesn't offer an endpoint for time entry data, so this is a workaround until they do.

It's highly specific to the organisation I work for, which is why there are a number of custom fields that are being pulled.
